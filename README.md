# 🗳️ Contactless Integrated Voting System (CIVS)

### **A Secure, Inclusive, and Touch-Free Voting System Using Hand Gestures & Speech Recognition**

## 📌 **Overview**
The **Contactless Integrated Voting System (CIVS)** is an innovative, secure, and user-friendly voting platform that enables voters to **cast their votes using speech and hand gestures**. This project is designed to ensure **safe and accessible voting**, eliminating the need for physical contact while also providing support for physically challenged individuals.

CIVS offers two distinct voting modes:
- 🎙️ **AGVS (Audio-Based Voting System)** – Voters cast their vote using speech recognition.
- ✋ **HGVS (Hand Gesture-Based Voting System)** – Voters cast their vote using predefined hand gestures.

This project has been **patented** and is currently in the **published stage**, awaiting grant approval.  
**Patent Number**: *[To be added]*  
**Patent Status**: *Published, yet to be granted*

📂 Training Data & Model Details

All the data used for training the model, including training accuracy, validation accuracy, and loss metrics, is available in this GitHub repository. Additionally, a Google Drive link will be provided where you can access all necessary training datasets, model files, and experimental results.

🏗️ How It Works

1️⃣ The voter selects Audio (AGVS) or Gesture (HGVS) voting.
2️⃣ If AGVS is chosen, the voter speaks the number assigned to a party.
3️⃣ If HGVS is chosen, the voter performs a hand gesture representing a party.
4️⃣ The system reconfirms the vote before finalizing.
5️⃣ The vote is securely cast and recorded.
